3,Strawberry Shortcakes,8,2,,15 mins,,"Preheat  the  oven  to  425°F. 

Mix  the  flour,  salt,  baking  powder,  and  3  tablespoons  of  the  sugar  in  a  bowl.  Grate  the  butter  into  these  dry  ingredients  and  use  your  fingertips  to  finish  crumbling  the  butter  into  the  flour.  Whisk  the  egg  into  the  cream,  and  pour  into  the  flour  mixture  a  little  at  a  time,  using  a  fork  to  mix.  You  may  not  need  all  of  the  eggy  cream  to  make  the  dough  come  together,  so  go  cautiously. 

Turn  the  dough  out  onto  a  lightly  floured  surface,  and  roll  gently  to  a  thickness  of  about  ¾  inch.  Dip  the  cutter  in  flour  and  cut  out  as  many  rounds  as  you  can.  Work  the  scraps  back  into  a  dough,  re-roll  and  finish  cutting  out—you  should  get  8  in  all.  Place  the  shortcakes  about  1  inch  apart  on  the  baking  sheet,  brush  the  tops  with  the  egg  white,  and  sprinkle  them  with  the  remaining  2  tablespoons  of  sugar.  If  it  helps  with  the  rest  of  your  cooking,  or  life  in  general,  you  can  cover  and  refrigerate  them  now  for  up  to  2  hours. 

Bake  for  10–15  minutes,  until  golden  brown,  and  let  them  cool  for  a  short  while  on  a  wire  rack.  Meanwhile,  crush  half  the  strawberries  with  the  spoonful  of  sugar  and  the  few  drops  of  balsamic  vinegar  if  using,  and  halve  or  quarter  the  remaining  strawberries,  depending  on  their  size.  Whip  the  heavy  cream,  if  you’re  using. 

The  shortcakes  should  be  eaten  while  still  warm,  so  split  each  one  across  the  middle  and  cover  with  a  spoonful  of  the  crushed  strawberry  mixture,  a  few  halved  or  quartered  strawberries,  then  dollop  some  whipped  cream  or  crème  fraîche  on  top,  and  set  the  top  back  on.",,http://www.reciperoulette.tv/#?recipe=116
4,Duck Stock,4,3,,45 min,,"In  a  large  pot,  heat  the  olive  oil  over  medium-high  heat  until  smoking  and  sear  the  duck  bones  until  golden  brown.  Add  the  onion,  celery,  and  carrots  and  sauté  2  to  3  minutes.  Add  the  bay  leaf,  peppercorns,  wine,  stock,  and  water  and  bring  to  a  boil. 

Reduce  the  heat  to  medium  and  simmer  for  45  minutes,  stirring  occasionally  and  skimming.  Strain,  cool  to  room  temperature,  then  refrigerate  until  the  fat  solidifies  and  lift  it  off  the  soup.  Refrigerate  up  to  1  week.  After  3  days,  bring  to  a  boil.  Then  boil,  skim,  and  cool  every  2  days;  or  freeze.",,http://www.reciperoulette.tv/#?recipe=465
5,Warm Mexican rice salad with borlotti beans & avocado salsa,2,3,,10minutes,,"Cook  the  basmati  rice  until  tender,  drain  and  leave  in  a  covered  pot  to  keep  warm. 
        Cook  the  garlic  with  the  chipotle  paste  for  a  couple  of  minutes  in  a  non-stick  pan.  Add  the  borlotti  beans,  cider  vinegar,  honey  and  season.  Cook  for  5  minutes  until  the  flavours  come  together. 
        Mix  the  avocado,  red  onion  and  pickled  jalapeños  and  lime  juice  together. 
        Divide  the  rice  between  two  plates,  spoon  beans  over  and  top  with  salsa.  Scatter  over  the  coriander  before  serving.

6,Crispy Tortillas with Guacamole,4,4,,5minute,,"Preheat  the  oven  to  400°F.  Meanwhile,  remove  and  discard  the  seeds  from  the  chillies;  squeeze  the  juice  from  the  limes;  peel  the  avocados,  remove  their  stones  and  chop  them;  and  roughly  chop  the  fresh  cilantro  leaves. 

To  make  the  guacamole,  mash  or  blend  the  chillies,  lime  juice,  avocado  and  cilantro  until  creamy  but  a  bit  chunky.  Season  with  salt  and  pepper,  and  pour  into  a  serving  dish. 

Brush  the  tortillas  with  the  oil,  season  with  salt  and  pepper  and  sprinkle  with  the  thyme  leaves.  Lay  them  on  a  baking  sheet–-don’t  overlap  them  too  much--and  bake  for  5  minutes  until  golden  brown,  then  leave  them  to  cool.  Break  into  wedges  if  you  like,  and  serve  the  crispy  tortillas  with  the  guacamole.",,http://www.reciperoulette.tv/#?recipe=270
7,Lamb Shanks Braise with Figs and Root Vegetables,4,7,,2 hours,,"1.  Lightly  sprinkle  lamb  with  salt  and  pepper  to  taste;  coat  all  over  with  flour.  In  large  Dutch  oven,  heat  half  of  the  oil;  brown  shanks,  in  batches  and  adding  more  oil  when  needed.  Remove  to  plate. 

2.  Stir  in  any  remaining  flour,  garlic,  basil,  paprika,  thyme,  cumin  and  coriander;  cook  over  medium  heat  for  1  minute,  stirring.  Stir  in  wine;  bring  to  boil,  scraping  up  any  brown  bits  from  bottom  of  pan.  Stir  in  1½  cups  (375  mL)  of  the  stock  and  tomatoes.  Return  shanks  and  any  juices.  With  scissors,  cut  stems  from  figs;  quarter  figs  and  add  to  stew.  Bring  to  boil;  cover  and  bake  in  350°F  (180°C)  oven  for  about  2  hours  or  until  lamb  is  very  tender,  stirring  occasionally. 
3.  Meanwhile,  in  deep  skillet  or  shallow  stovetop  casserole,  melt  butter  and  sugar  over  medium  heat;  stir  in  onions,  carrots,  parsnips  and  turnips  until  coated.  Sprinkle  with  salt  and  pepper  to  taste.  Add  remaining  stock  and  bring  to  boil.  Bake,  uncovered  and  stirring  occasionally,  in  350°F  (180°C)  oven  for  about  45  minutes  or  until  vegetables  are  tender.  Stir  into  cooked  shanks.

8,RoastTurkey with Spiked Gravy,12,200,,3.5 hour,,"1. Preheat the oven to 325°F (165°C). Remove the neck, giblets, and fat from the tail area and save for another use. Stuff the neck cavity loosely with stuffing, and pin the neck skin to the back with a skewer. Loosely fill the body cavity with stuffing and cover the exposed stuffing with foil. Using kitchen twine, tie the drumsticks together and secure the wings to the body. 

2. Place the turkey on a rack in a roasting pan. Rub with the butter and season with salt and pepper. Loosely cover the breast area with foil. Add 2 cups water to the pan. 

3. Roast, basting every hour or so (lifting the foil to do so), estimating about 15 minutes per pound, for about 3½ hours, until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thigh, not allowing it to touch a bone, reads 175°F (79°C). During the last hour of cooking, remove the foil. Transfer the turkey to a platter. Let stand for 30 minutes. 

4. Meanwhile, make the gravy. Pour the pan drippings into a glass bowl. Skim off and measure 6 tbsp fat; discard remaining fat. Add enough stock to degreased drippings to make 1 quart (1 liter). 

5. Place the pan over medium heat. Add the fat, whisk in the flour, and let cook 1 minute. Whisk in the stock mixture and bourbon, if using, scraping up the browned bits, and bring to a boil. Simmer over low heat, whisking often, until thickened, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and pour into a sauceboat. 

6. Carve the turkey and serve with the gravy.",,http://reciperoulette.tv/#?recipe=160
9,Ham in Coca-Cola,8,15,,2.5 hrs,,"If you know that you are dealing with a salty ham, put it in a pan covered with cold water, bring to the boil, then tip into a colander in the sink and start from here; otherwise, put the ham in a pan, skin-side down if it fits like that, add the onion, then pour over the Coke. Bring to the boil, reduce to a good simmer, put the lid on, though not tightly, and cook for just under 2½ hours. If your joint is larger or smaller, work out timing by reckoning on an hour for every 2 pounds, remembering that it's going to get a quick blast in the oven later. But do take into account that if the ham's been in the refrigerator right up to the moment you cook it, you will have to give it a good 15 minutes or so extra so that the interior is properly cooked. 

Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 500°F. 

When the ham's had its time, take it out of the pan (but do not throw away the cooking liquid) and let cool a little for ease of handling. (Indeed, you can let it cool completely then finish off the cooking at some later stage if you want.) Then remove the skin, leaving a thin layer of fat. Score the fat with a sharp knife to make fairly large diamond shapes, and stud each diamond with a clove. Then carefully spread the molasses over the bark-budded skin, taking care not to dislodge the cloves. Gently pat the mustard and sugar onto the sticky fat. Cook in a foil-lined roasting pan for approximately 10 minutes or until the glaze is burnished and bubbly. 

Should you want to do the braising stage in advance and then let the ham cool, clove and glaze it and give it 30/40 minutes, from room temperature, at 350°F, turning up the heat toward the end if you think it needs it. 

This is seriously fabulous with anything. ",,http://reciperoulette.tv/#?recipe=117
